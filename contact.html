                 Sadiya is an IT services specialist for the State of Minnesota where she works to support
                various state agencies with enterprise applications. She was born and raised in the small 
                town of Adaba in the Bale region of Ethiopia before immigrating to the United States in May 2000. 
                Thinking back to what lead her into IT, Sadiya recalls it wasn't until her sophomore
                year of college that she got into tech all thanks to a fundamentals class she took. 
                She might not have known what she was getting herself into then, but she loved the way 
                it continuously expanded her mind, how ubiquitous the field was in everyday life, 
                and the space it allowed for creativity and ease of learning on one's own.Enough so that she 
                continued her courses to earn a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Augsburg 
                University in 2017. After high school, Sadiya went on to join the Minnesota National Guard 
                in 2012 where she has served for the past 6 years as a Financial Management Technician.
                Although uncommon in the Oromo community, a career in service was a childhood interest for her, as she contemplated 
                going into either law enforcement or the military as young as 15 years of age.
                When asked about why she chose the military, she writes "Senior year of high school 
                I noticed a lot of my peers going down the wrong path, seeing that motivated me to be productive
                and seek out all the opportunities in front of me". She reports she's also gained 
                more confidence, maturity,strength, and lifelong friends.
